        <h3>Title</h3>
        <p>The title is a work in progress but it will relate to 'quotebook' or 'quoting'</p>
        <h3>Birthplace of the idea</h3>
        <p>For over a year, my friends and i have been 'quoting' anything funny we say in a specific channel on our discord server as a way to remeber, look back on and revisit funny moments. So I thought, what if there was a dedicated website that does exactly what we need...<br>So i searched.. and searched..<br>And I found nothing.</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Users would need to sign-up by creating an account. They would then be prompted to either make or join a quotebook. They would then be able to add a new quote to a book by entering the quote, the quotee, the date(and maybe time) the quote was said. Overtime they would have a large database of quotes.</p>
        <p>Essentials:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have a database for Users</li>
            <li>Have a database per quotebook</li>
            <li>Interact with quotebook database by adding, editing and:</li>
            <li>Fliter by quotee, between 2 dates (and maybe time), etc</li>
            <li>Sort by date ascending/descending (and maybe time)</li>
            <li>Group by quotees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nice to haves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quotebook stats about the book and users</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>My Stakeholders could be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thomas Wilderspin (classmate)</li>
            <li>Isaack Kennington (classmate)</li>
            <li>Mark Evans (Father)</li>
        </ul>
